# Java Fundamentals

**Author**: Haustin Kimbrough
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This is the space where I complete my labs for Code 401 Java.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
To do this on your own, clone or create a fresh repo from GitHub.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This is just a Java application for now.

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
